project-1 : IPL Dataset Analysis using numpy & matplotlib Data Analysis Project: IPL Player Performance & Salary Insights!

I'm thrilled to share the completion of my first data analysis project, where I delved into the world of IPL using Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. Over the course of this project, I analyzed data for 10 players across multiple seasons (2015-2024), focusing on their salaries, points scored, and matches played.

This experience was a fantastic learning journey that enhanced my skills in data manipulation and visualization. I uncovered interesting trends and insights into player performance and how it correlates with their earnings and on-field contributions. Iâ€™m excited to take these skills forward and explore even more complex datasets in the future!
